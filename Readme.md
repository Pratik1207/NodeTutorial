# Node.js Tutorial

This repository contains the basics of Node.js, starting with a simple "Hello World" program.

## Project Structure

```
node-tutorial/
â”‚â”€â”€ 01_Hello.js
â”‚â”€â”€ package.json
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md
```

### Files:
- **`01_Hello.js`**: A basic JavaScript file that logs a message to the console.
- **`package.json`**: Contains project metadata and scripts.

## Installation

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

```sh
node -v
```
If Node.js is installed, this command will display the version.

## Running the Project

To execute the script, use:

```sh
node 01_Hello.js
```

Or use the custom script:

```sh
npm run happy
```

## Notes

- The `window` object is not available in Node.js, as it is a browser-specific feature.
- This is just the beginning of the Node.js journey, and more features will be added soon.

Happy Coding! ðŸš€
